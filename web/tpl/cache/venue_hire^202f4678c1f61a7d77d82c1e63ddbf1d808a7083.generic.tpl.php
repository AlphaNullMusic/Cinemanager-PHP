<p>The Shoreline Cinema is available as a venue for your private function or fundraiser event. We specialize in creating unique movie experiences and we like to go that extra step to ensure your event is that little bit special. Listed below are a number of options we can help you with, and if you have any extra requirements, please talk to us.</p>
<p><span class="normal h3">Your Event as a Private Function</span></p>
<p>The Shoreline is available on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays for private bookings (daytime and evenings). On these days we can offer you a reduced rate if you book out one or both of our auditoriums. We have a 40 seat and 25 seat option, and depending on the film choice, we can show the same movie in both auditoriums to create a 65 seat option.</p>
<p><span class="h3">Your Event as a Fundraiser</span></p>
<p>Fundraising has never been simpler! Book either one or both of our theatres on a Monday, Wednesday or Thursday (daytime and evenings) and receive a reduced rate, work out how much you want to make, and add it to your ticket price. You can of course run raffles on the night and spot prizes. It's a lot less work than a sausage sizzle and a great night out for all.</p>
<p><span class="h3">Block Booking</span></p>
<p>If you are a smaller group or organization you can place a block booking with us. In some cases you can choose your own movie, however this is not always possible, and the session would also be open to the public. Alternatively you can choose any session off the current timetable. Standard rates would apply.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">2020 Private Screening Hire Deal.</span></strong></p>
<p>20 people or more for $20 per head includes a film and a glass of Bubbles. A current or recent title, group booking days or evenings. Ideal for Birthdays, Christmas functions or Girls Night out!</p>
<p><span class="h3">Movies</span></p>
<p>You can choose a movie from our current schedule, or we may be able to get a film that is of particular interest to your group. We will discuss options with you and also what time is suitable. We always have new films coming up, so you can even create your own premiere! NB. Due to the various technical formats we receive films on, sometimes we are unable to play certain titles in both cinemas. Please check with us first before deciding on a title.</p>
<p><span class="h3">Refreshments &amp; Finger Food</span></p>
<p>The ShoreLine has a superb range of quality wines and beers available over the counter and we also serve excellent espresso coffees and hot chocolates. Our range of fine cakes and nibbles are also at your disposal. You are also welcome to bring your own finger food (a particularly beneficial option for fundraisers).</p>
<p><span class="h3">Multi Media</span></p>
<p>If you have a special presentation requirement or simply want to play a DVD or slide show, we can help out there as well.</p>
<p><span class="h3">Prices</span></p>
<p>40 seat auditorium - $480</p>
<p>25 Seat auditorium - $300</p>
<p>Combined (65 Seats) - $780</p>
